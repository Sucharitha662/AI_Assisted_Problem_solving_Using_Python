# Function to find the largest number in a list

    if not numbers:
        return None
    largest = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if num > largest:

#Review
#The function is easy to read and understand.
#The logic is well-structured using a simple loop.
#Adding a docstring would improve documentation
#Returning None for an empty list,but we canalso raise an error to make it more explicit
#Efficient for small and large lists alike
