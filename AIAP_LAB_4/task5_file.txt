Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence systems trained on vast amounts of text data.
They are capable of understanding and generating human-like language.
LLMs can perform tasks such as translation, summarization, question answering, and code generation.
Popular examples include GPT, BERT, PaLM, and LLaMA.
They work by predicting the next word in a sequence, learning context and structure from massive datasets.
Fine-tuning allows LLMs to specialize in specific domains like medicine, law, or education.
Despite their power, LLMs can sometimes produce inaccurate or biased information.
Ethical use and responsible deployment are crucial for ensuring safe AI applications.
